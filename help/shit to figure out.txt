shit to figure out
	read an excel file (csv maybe but lets assume others too)
		if csv just use the php library (PHPExcel / phpspreadsheet)
	turn that data into an array
	do array ops on it (get bday)
	send email to HR members (basically pick who's in HR and sends them an email of the person's deets)
	make an interface to view the bdays (my specialty)
	make a cron job that runs daily (or if it cant be recurrent we can make it be a self calling code)


shit to do
	upload excel file
	parse excel serverside
	compares curdate with the fetched data
	send email (phpmailer via smtp)
	view for showing upcoming birthdays
	automate with cron jobs to run daily


tools we need
	phpexcel or phpspreadsheet
	cron jobs (whatever tools can do that without freaking out the server)
	shell_exec command in php
	phpmailer

proposed plan
	r&d on how to use the tools 		- ~1 day
	implement simple logic on how the tools can work
